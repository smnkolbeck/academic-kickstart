I am a criminal justice researcher with a Ph.D. in sociology from The Ohio State University. I apply advanced quantitative methodstostudy topics related to criminology and criminal justice. My published work, which has been featured by the [Council on Criminal Justice](https://counciloncj.org/does-stable-employment-post-release-reduce-recidivism/) and the [Criminology Academy Podcast](https://thecriminologyacademy.com/episode-67-kolbeck/), can be viewed [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F4LPHfc_Dw6Bzau8XkyS9656DswH6lLQb3Y8Zcv-aG0xjHKKx55B1aLnoWkYinP44UrcQlw5IBh6J7DniifAqfieiuDlQ&user=Dg7aMxEAAAAJ).  

My published work focuses on three interconnected lines of research: recidivism and reentry, the correlates of desistance from crime, and the relationship between employment and offending. My work on recidivism primarily probes whether and under what conditions employment is associated with declining recidivism risk among correctional populations. 

At the [Criminal Justice Research Center (CJRC)](https://cjrc.osu.edu/) I collaborate with Dr. Paul Bellair on various projects commissioned by local law enforcement agencies. In an ongoing collaboration with the Franklin County Sheriff's Office, I developed an [analytic tool](https://smnkolbeck.shinyapps.io/FranklinCounty_Crime_Explorer/) using R shiny that allows the user to explore crime trends in Franklin County, Ohio. In an effort to facilitate more efficient analyses of crime incident data, I am developing the [Crime Analyzer](https://github.com/smnkolbeck/CrimeAnalyzer) R package that provides a host of useful functions for analyzing crime incident data. Finally, in a recently completed project, Dr. Bellair and I completed a comprehensive crime analysis for the Columbus Police Department.
