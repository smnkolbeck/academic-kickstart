I am a graduate student in the The Ohio State University [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.osu.edu/) studying criminology.  

My research focuses on conditions that influence recidivism and desistance among the formerly incarcerated, with a focus on employment and cognitive factors. In addition, my work aims to enhance understanding on the relationship between work (both on and off-the-books) and crime.
I am currently involved in a number of projects that examine how employment, race, and cognitive change influences re-offending among the formerly incarcerated. 

At Ohio State, I am an affiliate of the [Criminal Justice Research Center (CJRC)](https://cjrc.osu.edu/) and am primarily advised by [Dr. Paul Bellair](https://sociology.osu.edu/people/bellair.1) and [Dr. Steven Lopez](https://sociology.osu.edu/people/lopez.137)
My personal interests include playing and watching soccer, board and card-games, and real-time strategy computer games.
