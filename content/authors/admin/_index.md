I am a sociology PhD student at The Ohio State University studying criminology.  The main aim of my research is to uncover the individual-level and structural conditions that affect a released offender's likelihood of reoffense. I am currently involved in a number of quantitative and mixed-method projects that examine the role of employment and cognition in reducing criminal offending after release from prison. My other work focuses on cross-national variation in homicide rates and the relationship between social ecologies, policing, and violence. My personal interests include playing and watching soccer, board and card-games, and real-time strategy computer games.
