I am a graduate student in the The Ohio State University [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.osu.edu/) studying criminology.  
The aim of my research is to uncover the ways in which individual-level and structural conditions influence the likelihood of re-offense of formerly incarcerated individuals. 
I am currently involved in a number of projects that examine the role of employment, race, cognition and other factors in reducing criminal offending among the formerly incarcerated. 
At Ohio State, I am an affiliate of the [Criminal Justice Research Center (CJRC)](https://cjrc.osu.edu/)
My personal interests include playing and watching soccer, board and card-games, and real-time strategy computer games.
